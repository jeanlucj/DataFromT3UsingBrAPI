There are separate marker and phenotype datasets in the `data` folder
The `code` folder contains code (`WrangleT3Downloads.Rmd`) to tidy up datasets
that were downloaded directly from T3. There is also a script
(`GetPhenoTrialdDataWithBrAPI.Rmd`) that shows how to get data from T3 without
using the GUI but using BrAPI calls.

just to prove my point.
